/**
 * Kernel threads, round-robin. The timer asks for a switch every tick, but a thread is only ever
 * switched out at a safepoint: a method prologue or a loop back-edge sees the request
 * (Magic.requestPreemption) and calls {@link #preempted}. Every frame of a parked thread therefore
 * sits at a call site with a stack map, and the collector scans parked stacks as precisely as the
 * running one.
 *
 * <p>Every CPU runs threads from one shared queue, and has an idle thread for when the queue is
 * empty. Queueing a thread kicks an idle CPU (Smp.kick) so it doesn't wait for its next tick.
 *
 * <p>All scheduler state is guarded by {@link #lock}, which also turns interrupts off. A switch
 * hands the lock over: the thread switched to is the one that releases it. Nothing allocates
 * under it: a CPU spinning on it with interrupts off can't stop for a collection, so a collection
 * started under it would wait forever.
